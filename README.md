# True Fulgora Conqueror

[日本語版はこちら / Japanese version](README.ja.md)

## Overview

**True Fulgora Conqueror** is a mod that adds a new enemy threat
and a focused defense experience to Fulgora.

In this mod, enemies emerge from ruins scattered across the planet.
Ruins that were once explored and left behind
become **dangerous locations that must be defended**.

---

## Concept

Fulgora is a planet defined by tight space and heavy constraints
on terrain, resources, and layout.

This mod treats those constraints
**not as disadvantages, but as the source of its fun**.

- You cannot rely on wide defensive lines  
- Unlimited expansion is not an option  
- Weapon choice and layout design become critical  

**Which weapon is optimal?  
Which layout is truly effective?**

The goal of this mod is to bring the joy of answering those questions
into the unique environment of Fulgora.

## What This Mod Adds to the Game

- Ruins shift from exploration targets to defense objectives  
- High-density defensive combat in extremely limited space  
- Clear differences in outcome based on weapon choice and layout  
- The satisfaction of finding optimal solutions through iteration  

This mod does not simply add more enemies.

It is a mod for players who want to **design defenses**, not just survive.

For those who felt something was missing
after defending Nauvis,
this mod offers a deeper and more focused experience.
